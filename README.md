# Introducing PicterGro
PicterGro is an automated robot to serve the Earth and the enviroment! <br>
This was designed for a robot design challenge hosted by PTC Waterloo in the Robotics Rebooted event. <br>
This design took appoximately 10 hours to complete on Fusion 360, and PicterGro won first prize for the challenge! <br><br>

# How PicterGro works
There are 3 main functions of PicterGro: <br>
1. Picking fruit / vegetables / plants
2. Planting trees
3. Watering plants / trees

All of the functions are attached onto a huge robotic arm on a base made from sheet metal. A water tank and wooden  <br> basket is put behind the arm. The water tank supplies water to the sprinkler that is attached by the gripper, which is made <br> possible by the water pump. The wooden basket is for the robot to put the vegetables or fruits, just like a farmer <br> would collect apples in a basket. Also, the wooden basket can be used to put tree seedlings which the robot will pick <br> it up and plant the tree. Everything is controlled on an online website, and everything is connected through the circuity and <br> an Arduino. The robot is accompanied by two cameras; a primary camera embedded within the sheet metal base <br> and a secondary camera that is above the gripper. Cameras will provide vision to the programs that use algorithms to identify <br> obstacles, create pathaways, and to see where the gripper is going. Finally, the mechanisms are all powered by servo motors <br> and a stepper motor.
